# Test Fixes Summary

## üîß Issues Fixed

### 1. ProductsService Tests - Missing BrandRepository Dependency

**Problem**: 
- The ProductsService now depends on BrandRepository but the tests weren't providing this dependency
- Error: `Nest can't resolve dependencies of the ProductsService (..., ?, ). Please make sure that the argument "BrandRepository" at index [3] is available in the RootTestModule context.`

**Solution**:
- Added `Brand` import to the test file
- Added `mockBrandRepository` mock object
- Added BrandRepository provider to the TestingModule configuration

```typescript
// Added import
import { Brand } from '../brands/entities/brand.entity';

// Added mock
const mockBrandRepository = {
  findOne: jest.fn(),
};

// Added provider
{
  provide: getRepositoryToken(Brand),
  useValue: mockBrandRepository,
},
```

### 2. ProductsService Tests - Updated Relations Expectations

**Problem**:
- The ProductsService now includes 'brand' in relations when fetching products
- Tests were expecting `['category', 'media']` but service now uses `['category', 'brand', 'media']`

**Solution**:
- Updated all test expectations to include 'brand' relation in the following methods:
  - `findAll()`
  - `findActive()`
  - `findOne()`
  - `findBySlug()`
  - `remove()`

**Before**:
```typescript
relations: ['category', 'media']
```

**After**:
```typescript
relations: ['category', 'brand', 'media']
```

### 3. ProductCategoriesService Tests - Missing brands Property

**Problem**:
- The ProductCategory entity now includes a required `brands` property (many-to-many relationship)
- Mock object was missing this property causing TypeScript errors

**Solution**:
- Added `brands: []` to the mockCategory object

```typescript
const mockCategory = {
  // ... other properties
  products: [],
  brands: [], // ‚Üê Added this
  createdAt: new Date(),
  updatedAt: new Date(),
};
```

## ‚úÖ Results
